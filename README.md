![Java CI with Gradle](https://github.com/katmatt/cross-compile-gh-actions/workflows/Java%20CI%20with%20Gradle/badge.svg?branch=master)

This is an example project for cross-compiling a Java application with gradle/graal/native-image via github actions. 

It uses the palantir graal gradle plugin and then runs the build on the different platforms.
